Supavec MCP Server is a new way to fetch relevant content from Supavec in LLMs.

## What is MCP?


[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) is a protocol Anthropic came up with that connects AI to stuff like your Google Drive and websites.

Think of it as a universal plug — just like how USB lets you connect different gadgets without needing special cables for everything.

## The problems MCP solves

The big problem it fixes? AI has been pretty isolated from real data. What good is a smart assistant if it can't even access your calendar?

MCP creates a standard way for information to flow between systems, so AI can actually give useful answers.

It's still a work in progress though — definitely not perfect yet. But I think it's pretty promising for making AI actually useful in day-to-day life. 

## Fetch relevant content to your question from Supavec with LLMs

Let's look at a simple example of how to use Supavec MCP servers on Claude Desktop app.

### 1. Download the MCP server

First, you need to download the MCP server from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/taishikato/supavec-mcp-server).

### 2. Build the MCP server

```bash
npm i && npm run build
```

### 3. Get your Supavec API key

Sign up at [Supavec](https://www.supavec.com) and get your API key.

### 4. Add the MCP Server to Claude for Desktop

Add the following to your `~/Library/Application\Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "supavec": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["path/to/supavec-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
        "env": {
            "SUPAVEC_API_KEY": "<your api key>"
        }
      }
    }
}
```

### 5. Let's try it out!

Open the Claude Desktop app and ask it to fetch relevant content from Supavec.

## Looking Forward

We're just getting started with Supavec. Our roadmap includes:

- More document format support (Excel, Word, etc.)
- Advanced query capabilities
- Integration with popular frameworks and platforms
- Enhanced visualization tools

## Join the Community

Supavec is not just a platform; it's a community of developers passionate about open-source AI infrastructure. We welcome contributions of all kinds:

- Code contributions
- Documentation improvements
- Feature requests
- Bug reports

Join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/taishikato/supavec) and [Discord](https://go.supavec.com/discord) to be part of building the future of RAG technology.

## Conclusion

The sudden shutdown of Carbon.ai taught us a valuable lesson about the importance of open-source infrastructure for critical AI applications. With Supavec, we're building not just a replacement but a better, more sustainable approach to RAG.

Try Supavec today and take control of your AI-powered document processing. Your data, your infrastructure, your rules.
