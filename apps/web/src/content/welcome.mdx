# Introducing Supavec: The Open-Source Alternative to Carbon.ai

When Carbon.ai was acquired by Perplexity and subsequently shut down, many developers were left without a critical tool in their RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows. This created a significant gap in the market for a reliable, scalable RAG solution. Today, we're excited to introduce **Supavec**, an open-source alternative that not only fills this gap but enhances what's possible with RAG technology.

## What is Supavec?

Supavec is an open-source platform that helps developers integrate AI with their data through a flexible, developer-friendly RAG infrastructure. Built with Supabase, Next.js, and TypeScript, Supavec allows you to:

- Upload documents (PDFs, text files) via a simple API
- Query your data using natural language
- Build powerful RAG applications with complete control
- Self-host or use our managed cloud service

Unlike Carbon.ai, Supavec is fully open-source under the MIT license, which means you have complete visibility into the code and can modify it to suit your specific needs.

## Why We Built Supavec

As developers who relied on Carbon.ai for various projects, we felt the pain when it shut down. This experience highlighted a critical issue with proprietary RAG solutions: you're at the mercy of business decisions completely outside your control.

We believe that infrastructure for AI applications should be:

1. **Transparent** - You should be able to see and understand how your data is processed
2. **Flexible** - Adapt to your specific use case without limitations
3. **Control-focused** - Your data remains yours, with options to self-host
4. **Sustainable** - Not dependent on a single company's business model

Supavec embodies these principles, providing an enterprise-grade RAG solution that won't disappear overnight.

## How Supavec Works

Let's look at a simple example of how to use Supavec:

```javascript
// Upload a PDF document
const response = await fetch('https://api.supavec.com/upload_file', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'your-api-key',
  },
  body: formData, // FormData containing your PDF
});

// Query your document using natural language
const embeddingsResponse = await fetch('https://api.supavec.com/embeddings', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'your-api-key',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What are the key findings in the document?",
    file_ids: ["your-file-id"],
  }),
});

const { documents } = await embeddingsResponse.json();
```

With just these few lines of code, you can extract relevant information from your documents using the power of AI.

## Key Features

### 1. Full Control with Open Source

Choose between our cloud version or self-host on your infrastructure. Unlike proprietary solutions, you're never locked in. The MIT license gives you the freedom to adapt and modify the code to suit your needs.

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Privacy

Built with Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), Supavec ensures your data stays private and secure on your infrastructure with granular access control.

### 3. Built to Scale

Handle millions of documents, process any size, support concurrent processing, and scale horizontally. Our architecture is designed to grow with your needs.

### 4. Developer-First

Simple API, comprehensive documentation, easy integration, and quick setup with a modern tech stack make Supavec a joy to work with.

## How Supavec Compares to Other Solutions

While there are other RAG solutions available, Supavec offers unique advantages:

| Feature | Supavec | Proprietary Solutions |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Source Code Access | ✅ Full access | ❌ Closed source |
| Self-hosting | ✅ Available | ❌ Typically not available |
| Data Privacy | ✅ Complete control | ❌ Limited control |
| Customizability | ✅ High | ❌ Limited |
| Business Continuity | ✅ Not dependent on a single company | ❌ Risk of shutdown/acquisition |
