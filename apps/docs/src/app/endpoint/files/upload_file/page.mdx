# Upload File

<Row>
  <Col>

  This endpoint is used to directly upload PDF or text files to Supavec. The `POST` request should be a multipart form request.

  Following is a description of all possible query parameters:
  - `chunk_size`: the chunk size (in tokens) applied when splitting the document
  - `chunk_overlap`: the chunk overlap (in tokens) applied when splitting the document

  <Note>
    Before you can make requests to the Supavec API, you will need to grab your
    API key from [your dashboard](https://www.supavec.com/dashboard).

      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        authorization: apiKey,
      },
      body: formData,
